     <p >Seated on a rocker chair somewhere in the beautiful Sahara, sipping on some ice tea as I watch the red sky and the sunset. Smiling to myself for having achieved that which my heart greatly did desire. It is only a dream; an aspiration that I WILL, I MUST accomplish. I am a 21 year old daughter of a tough African woman, a sister to many with a small circle of friends. Having been raised with one policy in an African, Christian household: Seize The Moment. Define your purpose and if a window of opportunity that does align with your values appear, don’t pull down the shade.</br>
    <p>Self-respect is top on my list of values. I have my boundaries defined and remaining authentic is what I’ll always hold on to. There is growth, emotionally and mentally, but that doesn’t mean I should completely change who I am. I am open to learning and correction whenever, I mean that is what life is all about, right? I follow the whispers of my heart, because that is where true wisdom always manifests itself. Family comes first all day any day! It doesn’t matter what is at stake, I will always choose my family without a doubt in a heart beat.</p>
    <p>A mug of coffee over tea will work with me any day. It is the thrill it brings and the peace of mind that always works for me. Water soothes my soul. There is some enigmatic magic in it: Meaning I take long showers listening to any kind of music but I wouldn't demur if I'm charged guilty for having Central Cee and 6lack on repeat more often than not. Every genre with it's playlist set aside. If I am having a bad day I am definitely listening to Gospel music for that reassurance and "Spirit-Buildup". I am a sunset lover. I feel more connected to my emotions every time I watch the sun set. How beautifully the horizon "swallows" the sun. Isn't it perplexing how endings can be beautiful too? </p>

   <p>“Life is persistent and the most urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’”
    -Martin Luther King JR.</br></p>
    <p>The art of giving is deeply rooted in my heart. It fills my heart with joy sharing anything I have. Be it knowledge, food, a pen you name it. It gladdens my heart just being there for someone since uncountable are the times someone has been there for me.  
    I crave excellence in Tech. The thought of being part of the 25% of Women In Tech globally blows of my mind completely and as soon as that is accomplished, I’ll be grinning from ear to ear. It will not be easy that I know, but it will be worth every struggle and every sacrifice. I’m looking forward to the years I’ll be running code as my cardio. The goal is to make money in my sleep.
    </p>
    <p>Everyday, oblivious of the next, is another chance for me to be appreciative of the far I have come as a strong lady persevering life itself and disregarding bad energy whatsoever since I am guided by a clear sense of purpose. I know what I want and I pray and work towards that. </p>
