            <p>RELIGION</p>
            <p>Come to think of it, most people find themselves converting religion as they grow up, not because they do not appreciate the religion they grew up believing in, but just because they set their minds free: to learn from the world and find a place where their hearts truly lie. It is evident, as children, we all did settle for the religion our parents did believe in, only because we had no option to choose, therefore ruling out faith as the main reason and having impressing our parents as its substitute.How are we so close, yet so far apart. Same religion, different denominations. Divided by different factors (that completely will never add up to me). We cry to the same God but praying in the same way in the same house in the same way is where we draw the line</p>

            <p>MATERNAL LOVE</p>
            <p>A mother will always be there for her children time and again. Without a doubt in a heartbeat a mother’s love will crash down all that stands in its path. She will always stay committed to ensuring she does raise a child who can fit in the society.. A mother’s love is the purest kind of love and is incomparable to nothing under the sun. With a lot of faith at heart, she believes that tomorrow will serve better. Best believe when she says trouble is coming,or joy is coming because: What a mother sees while seated, you’ll never see even while standing.</p>

             <p>DIVISION </p>
            <p>It is really frustrating knowing how rich we are yet we divide ourselves each and everyday  by petty reasons such as tribal differences. Africa can build itself. It has all the resources it needs to get to where it truly deserves to be. But first and foremost we need to do away with this scarcity mentality and tribalism that is deeply rooted in our heads. The earlier we embrace and love each other as a big family and accept the fact that we have been taken advantage of over the years because of our division, and start working towards a common goal the better it will be for the entire continent. </p>
